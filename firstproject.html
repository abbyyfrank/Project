      <h1>How to: Baseball Bows</h1>
      <br>
      <h3>Preparation</h3>
        <p> What you need...</p>
        <ol>
          <li> a baseball (very important)</li>
          <li> a hot glue gun</li>
          <li> heat up the glue gun</li>
          <li> glue for the hot glue gun (also very important)</li>
          <li> a hair clip (bobby pins are most likely not durable enough)</li>
          <li> a ribon of your chosing</li>
        </ol>
      <h3>"Skin" the Baseball</h3>
        <p> With an exacto knife, cut aroung the laces of the ball (WARNING: do not cut the laces!!) then peel off the part that you cut (the peice without the laces) and you may throw it away. Then peel off the peice with the laces, this is what you will make the bow out of. You may throw out the actual ball itself, we will not be using it for the rest of this process.</p>
      <h3>Glue the Baseball</h3>
        <p> Make an accordian fold in the middle of your baseball skin, and glue the middle together and promptly hold there until glue is dry. Next fold the curved edges of the baseball in so that the inside of the baseball is touching the inside corner of the edge. Glue the edge to the inside and hold until glue is dry. repeat for the other side of the baseball. You should start to see the bow shape form.</p>
      <h3>Ribbon Time!</h3>
        <p> With a ribon of your choosing, cut a peice that is appoximatley two inches. wrap that around the middle of your accordian fold (should be the thinnest part of your bow) and glue it in place making sure that you glue the ribbon on the back of the bow. (Glue the ribbon together by gluing the ribon to the ribon or the bow itself. DO NOT glue it on the outside of the ribbon or else the clip will not stick!!)</p>
      <h3>Clip it!</h3>
        <p> Last step!! Take your clip and glue it directly on the backside of the bow on the ribbon.</p>
      <h3>And you are done</h3>
        <p> Enjoy your bow!! :)</p>
